In order to run applications using PostgresDAC on Windows 64-bit platform, 
the PostgreSQL x64 client library must be available on a computer, it includes 
the following files:

    libpq.dll
    libintl-8.dll
    ssleay32.dll
    libeay32.dll

Copy these files to a directory on your PATH environment variable
or place them in the directory where the client application is installed.

Alternatively, you can make use of the installation package from
PostgreSQL.org and install only the client libraries.

PS There are no dump and restore libraries available for x64 platform yet.
