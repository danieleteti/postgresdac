
In order to run applications using PostgresDAC, the PostgreSQL client
library must be available on a computer, it includes the following
files:

 - comerr32.dll
 - krb5_32.dll
 - libeay32.dll
 - libiconv-2.dll
 - libintl-2.dll
 - libpq.dll
 - ssleay32.dll

Copy these files to a directory on your PATH environment variable
(e.g. Windows\System32) or place them in the directory where the
client application is installed.

Alternatively, you can make use of the installation package from
PostgreSQL.org and install only the client libraries.
