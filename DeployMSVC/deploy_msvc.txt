In order to run applications using PostgresDAC on Windows platform, 
the PostgreSQL client library must be available on a computer, it includes 
the following files:

    libpq.dll
    libintl-8.dll
    ssleay32.dll
    libeay32.dll

Copy these files to a directory on your PATH environment variable
or place them in the directory where the client application is installed.

Since official libraries depend on Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 redistributable package, 
it should be installed previously using vcredist_x86.exe file.

PS Dump and restore libraries are available in the official PostgresDAC installation.
