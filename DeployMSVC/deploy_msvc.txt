You need to check if proper VC Redist package is installed on your system!

In order to run applications using PostgresDAC on Windows platform, 
the PostgreSQL client library must be available on a computer, it includes 
the following files:

    libpq.dll
    libcrypto-1_1-x64.dll
    libiconv-2.dll
    libintl-9.dll
    libssl-1_1-x64.dll


Copy these files to a directory on your PATH environment variable
or place them in the directory where the client application is installed.

Since official libraries depend on Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 redistributable package, 
it should be installed previously using vcredist_XX.exe file.

PS Dump and restore libraries are available only in the official PostgresDAC installation.
